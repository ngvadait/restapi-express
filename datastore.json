Jessica, her best friend April, and a couple of other hot girls Lulu and Keecia visit the mall to hang out and do some shopping. They enter a new age store, where they check out a pair of ancient earrings. Unbeknownst to Jessica, these are magical ones set in ancient Abyssinia. A princess known as Princess Nawa is disgusted by the groom of her arranged marriage and switches bodies with a slave girl by means of an enchanted set of earrings. Since the earrings are not for sale, Jessica steals them. But the next morning she gets a big dose of reality when she wakes up in the body of a 30-something lowlife male, Clive, a career criminal. Clive finds himself in Jessica's body. Now it's up to Jessica (in Clive's body) to find a way to get her body back, while Clive (in Jessica's body) takes advantage of his new body to set in motion a crime spree to put the blame on Jessica!","Language":"English","Country":"USA","Awards":"4 nominations.","Poster":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzY1NTAzNTA3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMDA5Mzc3._V1_SX300.jpg","Ratings":[{"Source":"Internet Movie Database","Value":"5.5/10"},{"Source":"Rotten Tomatoes","Value":"22%"},{"Source":"Metacritic","Value":"29/100"}],"Metascore":"29","imdbRating":"5.5","imdbVotes":"82,831","imdbID":"tt0302640","Type":"movie","DVD":"25 Jan 2005","BoxOffice":"N/A","Production":"Buena Vista Distribution Compa","Website":"http://touchstonepictures.go.com/hotchick/index.html?CMP=IL10283","Response":"True"},
